The Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

Using 2018 data, created a storyboard to visualize usage by user type and compare primary usage during the weekday and weekend.
